# Panorama Swap Smart Contract Repository

Welcome to the Panorama Swap smart contract repository! Here, you'll find all the smart contracts that we are using in the Panorama Swap platform. We write our smart contracts using the ink! domain-specific language, which is designed for networks that run on the Substrate framework. The ink! contracts are compiled to WebAssembly, providing efficient and secure execution on the blockchain. We are proud to implement OpenBrush's PSP22 protocol and standard in our contracts.

** Note: We are continually updating and adding more smart contracts and in-depth information, so stay tuned for updates!**

## Contracts :
This repository contains the following smart contracts:

### contract_creator
contract_creator is a contract used to deploy and create trading_pair_azero, trading_pair_psp22 and multi_sig contracts. These contracts enable users to create their own liquidity pools and trading pairs on the Panorama Swap platform and multi sig wallets.

### PSP22
psp22 is a contract that implements OpenBrush's PSP22 standard with Cardinal-Cryptography implementation [https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/PSP22](https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/PSP22) , allowing the creation of PSP22 tokens with metadata extensions such as token name and symbol. This contract provides the functionality to manage PSP22 tokens on the Panorama Swap platform.

### trading_pair_azero
trading_pair_azero is a contract used in deploying AZERO/PSP22 trading pairs and pools on the Panorama Swap platform. This contract provides the necessary functionality to enable trading and liquidity provision for the AZERO/PSP22 pair.

### trading_pair_psp22 (Work in progress)
trading_pair_psp22 is a contract used in deploying PSP22/PSP22 trading pairs and pools on the Panorama Swap platform. This contract provides the necessary functionality to enable trading and liquidity provision for the PSP22/PSP22 pair.

### vesting_contract
vesting_contract is a smart contract that contains all the logic for the vesting program on the Panorama Swap platform. This contract is used to manage the vesting of tokens for different stakeholders according to predefined rules and conditions.

### airdrop_contract (No longer in use)
airdrop_contract is a smart contract that contains all the logic for the airdrop event on the Panorama Swap platform. This contract is used to distribute tokens to eligible participants in an airdrop campaign based on specific criteria and rules.

### multi_sig (Work in progress)
multi_sig is a smart contract that contains all the logic for a multiple signatures wallet on the Panorama Swap platform. This contract provides a secure and decentralized way to manage funds by requiring multiple signatures for certain operations, ensuring increased security and accountability.

## How to build and deploy the contracts

To build, compile and deploy your smart contract on Aleph Zero, you will need to install the development tools. the following link is to a great guide from Aleph Zero team: https://docs.alephzero.org/aleph-zero/build/installing-required-tools

**Enter to any smart contract that you wish to compile and build, for example AIRDROP_CONTRACT:**

```
cd airdrop_contract
cargo +nightly contract build --release
```

**After you successfully compile your contracts, you'll see** ```contract_name.contract```
**, which you'll need in order to deploy the smart contract to the Aleph Zero network, here is a great guide by the Aleph Zero team on how to deploy your contracts:** [https://docs.alephzero.org/aleph-zero/build/aleph-zero-smart-contracts-basics/deploying-your-contract-to-aleph-zero-testnet](https://docs.alephzero.org/aleph-zero/build/aleph-zero-smart-contracts-basics/deploying-your-contract-to-aleph-zero-testnet)

## How to run e2e tests ##

### prerequisites before running the e2e tests:

you have to install a Substrate node with pallet-contracts. By default e2e tests require that you install substrate-contracts-node. You do not need to run it in the background since the node is started for each test independently. To install the latest version:
```
cargo install contracts-node --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node.git
```

If you want to run any other node with pallet-contracts you need to change CONTRACTS_NODE environment variable:
```
export CONTRACTS_NODE="YOUR_CONTRACTS_NODE_PATH"
```

And finally enter the smart contract that you want execute (```airdrop_contract``` for example) the e2e tests and use the following command to start e2e test execution.

```
cd airdrop_contract
cargo test --features e2e-tests
```
